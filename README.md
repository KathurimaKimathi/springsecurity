Project provide secure user authentication for a Java web application using the Spring Security framework 
and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Users can register for an account, log in securely using their credentials, and 
optionally authenticate using external identity providers via OIDC. The application ensures data privacy and security 
by securely hashing passwords, implementing standard authentication mechanisms, and integrating with OIDC for 
decentralized authentication.
